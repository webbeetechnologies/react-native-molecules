## Getting Started

The monorepo has package-specific scripts. Follow the instructions in [packages/molecules/README.md](packages/molecules/README.md) for accurate install, dev, and test commands.

## Documentation

Detailed component and hook docs live under `docs/docs`. Start with `docs/docs/getting-started/customization.mdx`.

## Contributing

- Follow the lint rules enforced by `.github/workflows/lint.yml`.
- Use Node.js 20 and pnpm 9 for all development tasks.
- Open a draft PR early for feedback; mark it ready once lint/tests pass.
