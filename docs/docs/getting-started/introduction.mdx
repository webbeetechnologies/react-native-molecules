# Welcome to React Native Molecules

React Native Molecules is a comprehensive library of React Native + Web components powered by Material 3 tokens. Every component ships with production-ready props, sensible defaults, and live playground examples inside this documentation site.

## Why React Native Molecules?

-   **High Performance** – Built on top of `react-native-unistyles`, delivering excellent performance. On the web, it leverages CSS variables for efficient theming.
-   **Modular & Lightweight** – No barrel files means better tree-shaking. Components are self-registerable, so you only need to install external dependencies (like `@react-native-documents/picker`) if you use the specific components that require them.
-   **Fully Customizable** – Easily replace any internal component implementation using our register pattern or customize styles to match your brand.
-   **Unified Design** – Ships with Material 3 tokens by default, ensuring a consistent look and feel across React Native and Web.

## What you can find here

-   **Component deep dives** with behavior notes, prop tables, and live code examples.
-   **Hooks & utilities** that complement the component catalog and simplify state, context, and accessibility.
-   **Guides** for theming, responsive layouts, and platform-specific optimizations.

## Quick example

```tsx
import { Button } from 'react-native-molecules/components/Button';

export function MyComponent() {
    return <Button onPress={() => console.log('Pressed!')}>Click me</Button>;
}
```
